All input fields are necessary to submit the form. There are two buttons: Submit and Reset. Reset will clear the form, and when clicking on submit, it will first check all the fields for necessary validations. After validation, a popup will appear displaying all the selected values with the label in front of them. On closing the popup, the form should reset all the values.
